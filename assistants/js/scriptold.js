isInArray(or6, lastmsg)==true?(smsg=" <br><b>1.  Pleading to state material facts.</b><br> (1) Every pleading shall contain a brief statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for a claim or defence, as the case may be.<br> (2) The pleadings shall, when necessary, be divided into paragraphs, numbered consecutively; and dates, sums and numbers shall be expressed in figures. <br><b>2.  Items to accompany pleading.</b><br> Every pleading shall be accompanied by a brief summary of evidence to be adduced, a list of witnesses, a list of documents and a list of authorities to be relied on; except that an additional list of authorities may be provided later with the leave of court. <br><b>3.  Particulars to be given where necessary.</b><br>In all cases in which the party pleading relies on any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default or undue influence, and in all other cases in which particulars may be necessary, the particulars with dates shall be stated in the pleadings. <br><b>4.  Further and better statement or particulars.</b><br>A further and better statement of the nature of the claim or defence, or further and better particulars of any matter stated in any pleading, may in all cases be ordered upon such terms as to costs and otherwise as may be just. <br><b>5.  Condition precedent.</b><br> Any condition precedent, the performance or occurrence of which is intended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his or her pleading by the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be; and, subject thereto, an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent necessary for the case of the plaintiff or defendant shall be implied in his or her pleading. <br><b>6.  New fact must be specially pleaded.</b><br>The defendant or plaintiff, as the case may be, shall raise by his or her pleading all matters which show the action or counterclaim not to be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such grounds of defence or reply, as the case may be, as if not raised would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleadings, as, for instance, fraud, limitation act, release, payment, performance, or facts, showing illegality either by statute or common law <br><b>7.  Departure from previous pleadings.</b><br> No pleading shall, not being a petition or application, except by way of amendment, raise any new ground of claim or contain any allegation of fact inconsistent with the previous pleadings of the party pleading that pleading. <br><b>8.  Denial to be specific.</b><br> It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his or her written statement to deny generally the grounds alleged by the statement of claim, or for the plaintiff in his or her written statement in reply to deny generally thegrounds alleged in a defence by way of counterclaim, but each party must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he or she does not admit the truth, except damages. <br><b>9.  Joinder of issue.</b><br> (1) Subject to rule 8 of this Order, the plaintiff by his or her reply may join issue upon the defence; and each party in his or her pleading, if any, subsequent to reply, may join issue upon the previous pleading.<br> (2) The joinder of issue shall operate as a denial of every material allegation of fact in the pleading upon which issue is joined, but it may except any facts which the party may be willing to admit, and shall then operate as a denial of the facts not so admitted. <br><b>10.  Evasive denial.</b><br> When a party in any pleading denies an allegation of fact in the previous pleading of the opposite party, he or she must not do so evasively, but answer the point of substance. Thus, if it is alleged that he or she received a certain sum of money, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he or she received that particular amount, but he or she must deny that he or she received that sum or any part of it, or else set out how much he or she received. If the allegation is made with divers circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances. <br><b>11.  Denial of contract.</b><br> Where a contract is alleged in any pleading, a bare denial of the contract by the opposite party shall be construed only as a denial in fact of the express contract alleged, or of the matters of fact from which the contract may be implied, and not as a denial of the legality or sufficiency in law of the contract. <br><b>12.  Effect of document to be stated.</b><br> Wherever the contents of any document are material, it shall be sufficient in any pleading to state the effect of the contents of the document as briefly as possible, without setting out the whole or any part of the contents, unless the precise words of the document or any part of it are material. <br><b>13.  Malice, knowledge, etc.</b><br> Wherever it is material to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge or other condition of the mind of any person, it shall be sufficient to allege the same as a fact, without setting out the circumstances from which the malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge or other condition of the mind of any person is to be inferred. <br><b>14.  Notice.</b><br> Wherever it is material to allege notice to any person of any fact, matter or thing, it shall be sufficient to allege the notice as a fact, unless the form or the precise terms of the notice, or the circumstances from which the notice is to be inferred, are material. <br><b>15.  Implied contract or relation.</b><br> Whenever any contract or any relation between any parties is to be implied from a series of letters or conversations or otherwise from a number of circumstances, it shall be sufficient to allege the contract or relation as a fact and to refer generally to the letters, conversations or circumstances without setting them out in detail. If in such case the person so pleading desires to rely in the alternative upon more contracts or relations than one as to be implied from those circumstances, he or she may state them in the alternative <br><b>16.  Presumptions of law.</b><br> Neither party need in any pleading allege any matter of fact which the law presumes in his or her favour, or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side, unless the matter of fact has first been specifically denied, for example, consideration for a bill of exchange where the plaintiff sues only on the bill and not for the consideration as a substantive ground of claim. <br><b>17.  Technical objection.</b><br> No technical objection shall be raised to any pleading on the ground of any alleged want of form. <br><b>18.  Striking out unnecessary matter, etc.</b><br>The court may, at any stage of the proceedings, order to be struck out or amended any matter in any endorsement or pleading which may be unnecessary or scandalous or which may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action, and may in any such case, if it thinks fit, order the costs of the application to be paid as between advocate and client. <br><b>19.  Amendment of pleadings.</b><br> The court may, at any stage of the proceedings, allow either party to alter or amend his or her pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. <br><b>20.  Plaintiff may amend without leave.</b><br> A plaintiff may, without leave, amend his or her plaint once at any time within twenty-one days from the date of issue of the summons to the defendant or, where a written statement of defence is filed, then within fourteen days from the filing of the written statement of defence or the last of such written statements. <br><b>21.  Defendant amending without leave.</b><br> A defendant who has set up any counterclaim or setoff may without leave amend the counterclaim or setoff at any time within twenty-eight days of the filing of the counterclaim or setoff, or, where the plaintiff files a written statement in reply to the counterclaim or setoff, then within fourteen days from the filing of the written statement in reply. <br><b>22.  Disallowance of amendment.</b><br> Where a party has amended his or her pleading under rule 20 or 21 of this Order, the opposite party may within fifteen days from the date of service upon or delivery to him or her of the duplicate of the amended document apply to the court to disallow the amendment or any part of it; and the court may, if satisfied that the justice of the case requires it, disallow the amendment or any part of it or allow it subject to such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just. <br><b>23.  Amendment to be filed and served.</b><br> Whenever any pleading is amended, the amended document shall be filed within the time allowed for amending the pleading; and where the filing occurs before the date specified in the summons for the appearance of or the entering of appearance by the defendant, then a duplicate of the amended document shall be served upon the opposite party in the manner provided for the service of a summons, but where the amended document is filed after that date, a duplicate of the amended document shall be delivered to the opposite party by the party filing. <br><b>24.  Reply to amendment.</b><br> Where any party has amended his or her pleading under rule 20 or 21 of this Order, the opposite party shall plead to the amended pleading or amend his or her pleading within the time he or she then has to plead, or within fifteen days of the service or delivery of the amendment, whichever shall last expire; and in case the opposite party has pleaded before the service or delivery of the amendment, and does not plead again or amend within the time above mentioned, he or she shall be deemed to rely on his or her original pleading in answer to that amendment. <br><b>25.  Failure to amend after order.</b><br> If a party who has obtained an order for leave to amend does not amend accordingly within the time limited for that purpose by the order, or if no time is limited by the order then within fourteen days from the date of the order, he or she shall not be permitted to amend after the expiration of such limited time as aforesaid or the fourteen days, as the case may be, unless the time is extended by the court. <br><b>26.  Pleading to be signed.</b><br> Every pleading shall be signed by an advocate or by the party if he or she sues or defends in person. <br><b>27.  Pleadings in magistrates courts.</b><br> (1) Suits in a magistrate’s court may be instituted by lodging a plaint and may be tried without further pleadings unless the court otherwise orders.<br>(2) In a suit so tried issues shall be framed in accordance with Order XV of these Rules. <br><b>28.  Points of law may be raised by pleading.</b><br> Any party shall be entitled to raise by his or her pleading any point of law, and any point so raised shall be disposed of by the court at or after the hearing; except that by consent of the parties, or by order of the court on the application of either party, a point of law may be set down for hearing and disposed of at any time before the hearing. <br><b>29.  Dismissal of suit.</b><br> If, in the opinion of the court, the decision of the point of law substantially disposes of the whole suit, or of any distinct cause of action, ground of defence, setoff, counterclaim, or reply therein, the court may thereupon dismiss the suit or make such other order in the suit as may be just. <br><b>30.  Striking out pleading.</b><br> (1) The court may, upon application, order any pleading to be struck out on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or answer and, in any such case, or in case of the suit or defence being shown by the pleadings to be frivolous or vexatious, may order the suit to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as may be just.<br> (2) All orders made in pursuance of this rule shall be appealable as of right. <br><b>31.

Relief founded on separate grounds.</b><br> Where the plaintiff seeks relief in respect of several distinct claims or causes of action founded upon separate and distinct grounds, they shall be stated as far as may be separately and distinctly. <br><b>9.  Procedure on admitting plaint.</b><br> (1) The plaintiff shall present as many copies of the plaint as there are defendants, unless the court, by reason of the length of the plaint, or the number of the defendants, or for any other sufficient reason, permits him or her to present a like number of concise statements of the nature of the claim made, or of the relief claimed in the suit, in which case he or she shall present those statements.<br> (2) Where the plaintiff sues, or the defendant or any of the defendants is sued, in a representative capacity, the statements shall show in what capacity the plaintiff or defendant sues or is sued.<br> (3) The plaintiff may, by leave of the court, amend the statements so as to make them correspond with the plaint.<br> (4) The chief ministerial officer of the court shall sign the list of copies or statements, if, on examination, he or she finds them to be correct. <br><b>10.

(1) A defendant in an action may set off, or set up by way of counterclaim against the claims of the plaintiff, any right or claim, whether the setoff or counterclaim sounds in damages or not, and the setoff or counterclaim shall have the same effect as a cross-action, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final judgment in the same action, both on the original and on the cross-claim. But the court may on the application of the plaintiff before trial, if in the opinion of the court the setoff or counterclaim cannot be conveniently disposed of in the pending action, or ought not to be allowed, refuse permission to the defendant to avail himself or herself of it.<br>(2) Where a defendant includes a counterclaim in the defence, the defendant shall accompany it with a brief summary of evidence to be adduced, a list of witnesses, a list of documents and a list of authorities to be relied on. <br>3.  <b>Specific denial.</b><br> Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the opposite party, shall be taken to be admitted, except as against a person under disability;
